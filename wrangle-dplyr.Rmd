## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

mpg

 <! -- displ, a car’s engine size, in litres.
hwy, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency
consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.-->


ggplot(data = mpg)

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

– geom_point() for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
– geom_bar() for bar charts
– geom_line() for trend lines, time-series, etc.

ggplot(data = mpg, aes (x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point()

# Assign plot to a variable
car_plot <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

car_plot + geom_point()
